.SH NAME
timew-annotate \- add an annotation to intervals
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B timew annotate
[
.I <id>
.B ...
]
.I <annotation>
.B ...
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 'annotate' command is used to add an annotation to an interval.
Using the 'summary' command, and specifying the ':ids' hint shows interval IDs.
Using the right ID, you can identify an interval to annotate.
.
.SH EXAMPLES
For example, show the IDs:
.RS
$ timew summary :week :ids
.RE
Then having selected '@2' as the interval you wish to annotate:
.RS
$ timew annotate @2 'Lorem ipsum...'
.RE
Note that you can annotate multiple intervals with the same annotation:
.RS
$ timew annotate @2 @10 @23 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...'
.RE
If there is active time tracking, you can omit the ID when you want to add annotations to the current open interval:
.RS
$ timew start foo
.br
$ timew annotate bar
.RE
This results in the current interval having annotations 'foo' and 'bar'.
.
SH BUGS
Currently the annotation command picks the last token from the command line and uses it as annotation.
I.e. using no quotes in an annotation command like
.RS
$ timew annotate @1 lorem ipsum dolor
.RE
will result in interval @1 having only 'dolor' as its annotation.
