.SH NAME
timew \- A command line time tracker.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B timew <command> [<arg> ...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Timewarrior is a command line time tracker. It allows you to easily track your
time and generate summary reports.

This is a reference, not a tutorial. If you are looking for a tutorial, check
the online documentation here:

  https://taskwarrior.org/docs/timewarrior

.SH SUBCOMMANDS

Timewarrior supports many commands. Alphabetically:

.TP
.B timew
.br
When run without arguments, the default command is run, which indicates whether
there is any active tracking, and if so, shows a summary, then exits with a code
0. If there is no active time tracking, exit code is 1.
See also 'get'.

.TP
.B timew cancel
If there is an open interval, it is abandoned.
See also 'stop'.

.TP
.B timew config [<name> [<value> | '']]
Allows setting and removing configuration values, as an alternative to directly
editing your ~/.timewarrior/timewarrior.cfg file. For example:

  $ timew config verbose yes
  $ timew config verbose ''
  $ timew config verbose

The first command sets 'verbose' to 'yes'. The second sets it to a blank value
which overrides the default value. The third example deletes the 'verbose'
setting.

When modifying configuration in this way, interactive confirmation will be
sought. To override this confirmation, use the ':yes' hint, which means you
intend to answer 'yes' to the confirmation questions:

  $ timew config verbose '' :yes

If no arguments are provided, all configuration settings are shown:

  $ timew config
  verbose = yes
  ...

See also 'hints', 'show'.

.TP
.B timew continue
Resumes tracking of closed intervals. For example:

  $ timew track 9am - 10am tag1 tag2
  $ timew track 11am - 1pm tag3
  $ timew continue @2

The 'continue' command creates a new interval, starting now, and using the
tags 'tag1' and 'tag2'.
Using the 'summary' command and specifying the ':ids' hint shows interval IDs.
This command is a convenient way to resume work without re-entering the
tags.

See also 'start', 'stop'.

.TP
.B timew day [<interval>] [<tag> ...]
The day command shows a chart depicting a single day (today by default), with
colored blocks drawn on a timeline. The chart summarizes the tracked and
untracked time.

Charts accept date ranges and tags for filtering, or shortcut hints:

  $ timew day monday - today
  $ timew day :week
  $ timew day :month

The 'reports.day.range' configuration setting overrides the default date range.
The default date range shown is ':day'.

The ':blank' hint causes only the excluded time to be shown, with no tracked
time. This can be used to see the exclusions.

For more details, and precise times, use the 'summary' report.

See also 'week', 'month', 'summary'.

.TP
.B timew delete @<id> [@<id> ...]
Deletes an interval. Using the 'summary' command, and specifying the ':ids' hint
shows interval IDs. Using the right ID, you can identify an interval to delete.
For example, show the IDs:

  $ timew summary :week :ids

Then having selected '@2' as the interval you wish to delete:

  $ timew delete @2

See also 'cancel'.

.TP
.B timew diagnostics
This command shows details about your version of Timewarrior, your platform, how
it was built, compiler features, configuration, file access, extensions and more.
The purpose of this command is to help diagnose configuration problems and
provide supplemental information when reporting a problem. See also 'extensions'.

.TP
.B timew export [<interval>] [<tag> ...]
Exports all the tracked time in JSON format. Supports filtering. For example:

  $ timew export from 2016-01-01 for 3wks tag1

.TP
.B timew extensions
Displays the directory containing the extension programs and a table showing
each extension and its status. See also 'diagnostics'.

.TP
.B timew fill @<id> [@<id> ...]

The 'fill' command is used to adjust any interval to fill in surrounding gaps.
Using the 'summary' command, and specifying the ':ids' hint shows interval IDs.
Using the right ID, you can identify an interval to fill. For example, show
the IDs:

  $ timew summary :week :ids

Then having selected '@2' as the interval you wish to fill:

  $ timew fill @2

Note that you can fill multiple intervals:

  $ timew fill @2 @10 @23

See also 'hints'.

.TP
.B timew gaps [<interval>] [<tag> ...]
Displays a summary of time that is neither tracked nor excluded from tracking.

The 'reports.gaps.range' configuration setting overrides the default date range.
The ':blank' hint causes only the excluded time to be shown, with no tracked
time.
The default date range shown is ':day'.

The ':blank' hint causes only the excluded time to be shown, with no tracked
time.

See also 'summary'.

.TP
.B timew get <DOM> [<DOM> ...]
Validates the DOM reference, then obtains the value and displays it. For example:

  $ timew get dom.active
  1

It is an error to reference an interval or tag that does not exist.
See also 'DOM'.

.TP
.B timew help [<command> | interval | hints | date | duration]
The help command shows detailed descriptions and examples of commands,
interval syntax, supported hints, date and duration formats and DOM references.
For example:

  $ timew help
  $ timew help start
  $ timew help hints
  $ timew help interval
  $ timew help date
  $ timew help duration
  $ timew help dom

.TP
.B timew join @<id> @<id>
Joins two intervals, by using the earlier of the two start times, and the later
of the two end times, and the combined set of tags. Using the 'summary' command,
and specifying the ':ids' hint shows interval IDs. Using the correct IDs, you
can identify an intervals to join. For example, show the IDs:

  $ timew summary :week :ids

Then having selected '@1' and '@2' as the intervals you wish to join:

  $ timew join @1 @2

See also 'split', 'lengthen', 'shorten', 'resize'.

.TP
.B timew lengthen @<id> [@<id> ...] <duration>
The 'lengthen' command is used to defer the end date of a closed interval.
Using the 'summary' command, and specifying the ':ids' hint shows interval IDs.
Using the right ID, you can identify an interval to lengthen. For example, show
the IDs:

  $ timew summary :week :ids

Then having selected '@2' as the interval you wish to lengthen:

  $ timew lengthen @2 10mins

Note that you can lengthen multiple intervals,:

  $ timew lengthen @2 @10 @23 1hour

See also 'summary', 'tag', 'untag', 'shorten', 'resize'.

.TP
.B timew month [<interval>] [<tag> ...]
The month command shows a chart depicting a single month (current month by
default), with colored blocks drawn on a timeline. The chart summarizes the
tracked and untracked time.

Accepts date ranges and tags for filtering, or shortcut hints:

  $ timew month 1st - today
  $ timew month :week

The 'reports.month.range' configuration setting overrides the default date range.
The default date range shown is ':month'.

The ':blank' hint causes only the excluded time to be shown, with no tracked
time.

For more details, and precise times, use the 'summary' report.

See also 'day', 'week', 'summary'.

.TP
.B timew move @<id> <date>
The 'move' command is used to reposition an interval at a new start time.
Using the 'summary' command, and specifying the ':ids' hint shows interval IDs.
Using the right ID, you can identify an interval to move. For example, show
the IDs:

  $ timew summary :week :ids

Then having selected '@2' as the interval you wish to move:

  $ timew move @2 9am

See also 'summary', 'tag', 'untag', 'lengthen', 'shorten', 'resize'.

.TP
.B timew [report] <report> [<interval>] [<tag> ...]
Runs an extension report, and supports filtering data.
The 'report' command itself is optional, which means that these two commands
are equivalent:

  $ timew report foo :week
  $ timew        foo :week

This does however assume there is a 'foo' extension installed.

.TP
.B timew resize @<id> [@<id> ...] <duration>
The 'resize' command is used to change the duration of a closed interval.
Using the 'summary' command, and specifying the ':ids' hint shows interval IDs.
Using the right ID, you can identify an interval to resize. For example, show
the IDs:

  $ timew summary :week :ids

Then having selected '@3' as the interval you wish to resize:

  $ timew resize @3 15mins

Note that you can resize multiple intervals,:

  $ timew resize @3 @1 @13 1hour

See also 'summary', 'tag', 'untag', 'lengthen', 'shorten'.

.TP
.B timew shorten @<id> [@<id> ...] <duration>
The 'shorten' command is used to advance the end date of a closed interval.
Using the 'summary' command, and specifying the ':ids' hint shows interval IDs.
Using the right ID, you can identify an interval to shorten. For example, show
the IDs:

  $ timew summary :week :ids

Then having selected '@2' as the interval you wish to shorten:

  $ timew shorten @2 10mins

Note that you can shorten multiple intervals,:

  $ timew shorten @2 @10 @23 1hour

See also 'summary', 'tag', 'untag', 'lengthen', 'resize'.

.TP
.B timew show
Displays the effective configuration in hierarchical form.
See also 'config'.

.TP
.B timew split @<id> [@<id> ...]
Ѕplits an interval into two equally sized adjacent intervals, having the same
tags. Using the 'summary' command, and specifying the ':ids' hint shows interval
 IDs. Using the right ID, you can identify an interval to split. For example,
show the IDs:

  $ timew summary :week :ids

Then having selected '@2' as the interval you wish to split:

  $ timew split @2

See also 'join', 'lengthen', 'shorten'.

.TP
.B timew start [<date>] [<tag> ...]
Begins tracking using the current time with any specified set of tags.
If a tag contains multiple words, therefore containing spaces, use quotes to
surround the whole tag. For example, this command specifies two tags ('weekend'
and 'Home & Garden'), the second of which requires quotes.

  $ timew start weekend 'Home & Garden'

An optional date may be specified to indicate the intended start of the tracked
time:

  $ timew start 8am weekend 'Home & Garden'

If there is a previous open interval, it will be closed at the given start time.

Quotes are harmless if used unnecessarily. See also 'continue', 'stop', 'track'.

.TP
.B timew stop [<tag> ...]
Stops tracking time. If tags are specified, then they are no longer tracked.
If no tags are specified, all tracking stops. For example:

  $ timew start tag1 tag2
  ...
  $ timew stop tag1

Initially time is tracked for both 'tag1' and 'tag2', then 'tag1' tracking is
stopped, leaving tag2 active. To stop all tracking:

  $ timew stop

See also 'cancel', 'continue', 'start', 'track'.

.TP
.B timew summary [<interval>] [<tag> ...]
Displays a report summarizing tracked and untracked time for the current day by
default. Accepts date ranges and tags for filtering, or shortcut hints:

  $ timew summary monday - today
  $ timew summary :week
  $ timew summary :month

The ':ids' hint adds an 'ID' column to the summary report output for interval
modification.

See also 'day', 'week', 'month', 'shorten', 'lengthen', 'tag', 'untag'.

.TP
.B timew tag @<id> [@<id> ...] <tag> [<tag> ...]
The 'tag' command is used to add a tag to an interval. Using the 'summary'
command, and specifying the ':ids' hint shows interval IDs. Using the right ID,
you can identify an interval to tag. For example, show the IDs:

  $ timew summary :week :ids

Then having selected '@2' as the interval you wish to tag:

  $ timew tag @2 'New Tag'

Note that you can tag multiple intervals, with multiple tags:

  $ timew tag @2 @10 @23 'Tag One' tag2 tag3

See also 'summary', 'shorten', 'lengthen', 'untag'.

.TP
.B timew tags [<interval>] [<tag> ...]
Displays all the tags that have been used by default. When a filter is specified,
shows only the tags that were used during that time.

.TP
.B timew track <interval> [<tag> ...]
The track command is used to add tracked time in the past. Perhaps you forgot
to record time, or are just filling in old entries. For example:

  $ timew track :yesterday 'Training Course'
  $ timew track 9am - 11am 'Staff Meeting'

Note that the track command expects a closed interval (start and end time), when
recording. If a closed interval is not provided, the 'track' command behaves the
same as the 'start' command.

.TP
.B timew untag @<id> [@<id> ...] <tag> [<tag> ...]
The 'untag' command is used to remove a tag from an interval. Using the 'summary'
command, and specifying the ':ids' hint shows interval IDs. Using the right ID,
you can identify an interval to untag. For example, show the IDs:

  $ timew summary :week :ids

Then having selected '@2' as the interval you wish to untag:

  $ timew untag @2 'Old Tag'

Note that you can untag multiple intervals, with multiple tags:

  $ timew untag @2 @10 @23 'Old Tag' tag2 tag3

See also 'summary', 'shorten', 'lengthen', 'tag'.

.TP
.B timew week [<interval>] [<tag> ...]
The week command shows a chart depicting a single week (current week by
default), with colored blocks drawn on a timeline. The chart summarizes the
tracked and untracked time.

Accepts date ranges and tags for filtering, or shortcut hints:

  $ timew week
  $ timew week monday - today

The 'reports.week.range' configuration setting overrides the default date range.
The default date range shown is ':week'.

The ':blank' hint causes only the excluded time to be shown, with no tracked
time.

For more details, and precise times, use the 'summary' report.

See also 'day', 'month', 'summary'.

.SH INTERVAL
An interval defines a block of time that is tracked. The syntax for specifying
an interval is flexible, and may be one of:

  [from] <date>
  [from] <date> to/- <date>
  [from] <date> for <duration>
  <duration> before/after <date>
  <duration> ago
  [for] <duration>

Examples are:

  from 9:00
  from 9am - 11am
  from 9:00:00 to 11:00
  from 9:00 for 2h
  2h after 9am
  2h before 11:00
  2h ago
  for 2h

An interval is said to be 'closed' if there is both a start and end, and 'open'
if there is no end date.

.SH HINTS
Timewarrior supports hints, which are single-word command line features that
start with a colon like this:

  :week

Hints serve several purposes. This example is a shortcut for the date range
that defines the current week. Other hints, such as:

  :quiet

Are ways to control the behavior of Timewarrior, in this case eliminating all
forms of feedback, for purposes of automation. The supported hints are:

  :quiet         Turns off all feedback. For automation
  :debug         Runs in debug mode, shows many runtime details
  :yes           Overrides confirmation by answering 'yes' to the questions

  :color         Force color on, even if not connected to a TTY
  :nocolor       Force color off, even if connected to a TTY
  :blank         Leaves tracked time out of a report
  :fill          Expand time to fill surrounding available gap
  :adjust        Automatically correct overlaps
  :ids           Displays interval ID numbers in the summary report

Range hints provide convenient shortcuts to date ranges:

  :yesterday     The 24 hours of the previous day
  :day           The 24 hours of the current day
  :week          This week
  :month         This month
  :quarter       This quarter
  :year          This year
  :lastweek      Last week
  :lastmonth     Last month
  :lastquarter   Last quarter
  :lastyear      Last year
  :monday        Previous monday
  :tuesday       Previous tuesday
  :wednesday     Previous wednesday
  :thursday      Previous thursday
  :friday        Previous friday
  :saturday      Previous saturday
  :sunday        Previous sunday

  dom.rc.<name>             Configuration setting

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE AND OVERRIDE OPTIONS
Timewarrior stores its configuration in a file in the user's home directory:
~/.timewarrior/timewarrior.cfg.

This file contains a mix of rules and configuration settings. Note that the
environment variable $TIMEWARRIORDB can be set to override this location.

The values 'true', '1', 'y', 'yes' and 'on' are all equivalent and enable a
setting. Any other value means disable the setting.

Default values may be overridden by timewarrior.cfg values, which may in turn be
overridden on the command line using:

  rc.<name>=<value>

For example, to turn off verbose mode:

  rc.verbose=0

Note that hints can also do this (:quiet).
