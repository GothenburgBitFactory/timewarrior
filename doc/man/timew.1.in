.SH NAME
timew \- A command line time tracker.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B timew <command> [<arg> ...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Timewarrior is a command line time tracker. It allows you to easily track your
time and generate summary reports.

This is a reference, not a tutorial. If you are looking for a tutorial, check
the online documentation here:

  https://taskwarrior.org/docs/timewarrior

.SH SUBCOMMANDS

Timewarrior supports many commands. Alphabetically:

.TP
.B timew
.br
When run without arguments, the default command is run, which indicates whether
there is any active tracking, and if so, shows a summary, then exits with a code
0. If there is no active time tracking, exit code is 1.
See also 'get'.

.SH INTERVAL
An interval defines a block of time that is tracked. The syntax for specifying
an interval is flexible, and may be one of:

  [from] <date>
  [from] <date> to/- <date>
  [from] <date> for <duration>
  <duration> before/after <date>
  <duration> ago
  [for] <duration>

Examples are:

  from 9:00
  from 9am - 11am
  from 9:00:00 to 11:00
  from 9:00 for 2h
  2h after 9am
  2h before 11:00
  2h ago
  for 2h

An interval is said to be 'closed' if there is both a start and end, and 'open'
if there is no end date.

.SH HINTS
Timewarrior supports hints, which are single-word command line features that
start with a colon like this:

  :week

Hints serve several purposes. This example is a shortcut for the date range
that defines the current week. Other hints, such as:

  :quiet

Are ways to control the behavior of Timewarrior, in this case eliminating all
forms of feedback, for purposes of automation. The supported hints are:

  :quiet         Turns off all feedback. For automation
  :debug         Runs in debug mode, shows many runtime details
  :yes           Overrides confirmation by answering 'yes' to the questions

  :color         Force color on, even if not connected to a TTY
  :nocolor       Force color off, even if connected to a TTY
  :blank         Leaves tracked time out of a report
  :fill          Expand time to fill surrounding available gap
  :adjust        Automatically correct overlaps
  :ids           Displays interval ID numbers in the summary report

Range hints provide convenient shortcuts to date ranges:

  :yesterday     The 24 hours of the previous day
  :day           The 24 hours of the current day
  :week          This week
  :month         This month
  :quarter       This quarter
  :year          This year
  :lastweek      Last week
  :lastmonth     Last month
  :lastquarter   Last quarter
  :lastyear      Last year
  :monday        Previous monday
  :tuesday       Previous tuesday
  :wednesday     Previous wednesday
  :thursday      Previous thursday
  :friday        Previous friday
  :saturday      Previous saturday
  :sunday        Previous sunday

  dom.rc.<name>             Configuration setting

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE AND OVERRIDE OPTIONS
Timewarrior stores its configuration in a file in the user's home directory:
~/.timewarrior/timewarrior.cfg.

This file contains a mix of rules and configuration settings. Note that the
environment variable $TIMEWARRIORDB can be set to override this location.

The values 'true', '1', 'y', 'yes' and 'on' are all equivalent and enable a
setting. Any other value means disable the setting.

Default values may be overridden by timewarrior.cfg values, which may in turn be
overridden on the command line using:

  rc.<name>=<value>

For example, to turn off verbose mode:

  rc.verbose=0

Note that hints can also do this (:quiet).

.TP
.B confirmation = yes
Determines whether harmful operations require interactive confirmation.
May be overridden by the ':yes' hint.
Default value is 'yes'.

.TP
.B debug = off
Determines whether diagnostic debugging information is shown.
Useful for troubleshooting, but not for general use.
Default value is 'off'.

.TP
.B debug.indicator = >>
The debug output prefix string.
Default value is '>>'.

.TP
.B reports.<type>.cell = 15
.br
Determines how many minutes are represented by a single character cell, for the
charts.
A value of '15' means that an hour is represented by 60/15, or 4 character cells.
Suitable values are the divisors of 60 (30, 20, 15, 12, ...).
The value must be greater than '0'.
Default value is '15'.
Type is one of 'month', 'week', 'day'.

.TP
.B reports.<type>.day = yes
.br
Determines whether the current day of the month is shown at left margin.
Default value is 'yes'.
Type is one of 'month', 'week', 'day'.

.TP
.B reports.<type>.holidays = yes
.br
Determines whether relevant holidays are shown beneath the report.
Default value is 'yes'.
Type is one of 'month', 'week', 'day', 'summary'.

.TP
.B reports.<type>.hours = all
.br
Determines how the <type> report shows all the hours in a day ('all'), or is
limited to only hours where data is tracked ('auto'). Default value is 'all'.
Type is one of 'month', 'week', 'day'.

.TP
.B reports.<type>.lines = 1
.br
Determines how many lines are used to render each day on the <type> report.
Default value is '1'.
Type is one of 'month', 'week', 'day'.

.TP
.B reports.<type>.month = yes
.br
Determines whether the current month is shown at left margin.
Default value is 'yes'.
Type is one of 'month', 'week', 'day'.

.TP
.B reports.<type>.range = <range hint>
.br
For reports that show a range of data, this setting will override the default
value. The value should be a range hint, see 'hints'
Type is one of 'gaps', 'day', 'week', 'month'.

.TP
.B reports.<type>.spacing = 1
.br
Specifies how many spaces are inserted between the hours in the <type> report
exclusions. A value of '0' yields a more compact report. Default value is '1'.
Type is one of 'month', 'week', 'day'.

.TP
.B reports.<type>.axis = external
.br
The value 'internal' puts the hour markers (time line at the top) inside the
exclusion blocks, 'external' puts the hour markers in a separate line;
additional values might be defined in the future. Default is 'internal' for
the day report and 'external' for other reports.

.TP
.B reports.<type>.summary = on
.br
Determines whether the hours summary is shown. Default value is 'on'.
Type is one of 'month', 'week', 'day'.

.TP
.B reports.<type>.totals = on
.br
Determines whether the time totals are shown for each day on the report.
Default value is 'on'.
Type is one of 'month', 'week', 'day'.

.TP
.B reports.<type>.week = yes
