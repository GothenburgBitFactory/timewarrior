Timewarrior Holiday Files
=========================

The holiday files were created using http://holidata.net data by the 'refresh'
script. This data can be updated using these commands:

  $ ./refresh

If you need another locale (for example sv-SE), do this:

  $ ./refresh --locale sv-SE

If you need a specific locale region, do this:

  $ ./refresh --locale de-CH --region Bern

By default, the current and next year are updated. If the locale is not
supported by holidata.net, or there is no data (yet) for the locale for this
year and next year, you will see an error.

To specify a set of years to update, do this:

  $ ./refresh --locale en-US --year 2015 2016 2017
