Timewarrior Holiday Files
=========================

The holiday files were created using http://holidata.net data by the 'refresh'
script. This data can be updated using these commands:

  $ ./refresh

If you need another locale (for example sv-SE), do this:

  $ ./refresh --locale sv-SE

If you need a specific locale region, do this:

  $ ./refresh --locale de-CH --region Bern

If the locale is not supported by holidata.net, or the there is no data (yet)
for the locale for this year and next year, you will see an error.
