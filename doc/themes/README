# Timewarrior Color Themes

The theme files define colors that Timewarrior uses in various situations.
There are several themes provided with Timewarrior, and you use a theme by importing it into your configuration file.
Edit this file:

    ~/.timewarrior/timewarrior.cfg

And add the import line, which looks like this:

    import /path/to/theme/dark.theme

## Create Your Own

It is easy to create your own Timewarrior color theme.
The simplest approach is to copy an existing theme and then modify the colors.

There is no minimum requirement for a theme - it doesn't need to define any colors, but that isn't really the point of a theme.
Ideally define a description which is shown in the 'diagnostics' command output:

    theme.description         Description of the theme.

The individual color settings are all used by Taskwarrior, and providing a color for each of these is best.
If no color is provided for a setting, then no color is used, a default does not apply.
Color settings include:

    theme.colors.exclusion    Used to color excluded time in reports
    theme.colors.today        Used to highlight today on reports that show dates
    theme.colors.label        Used for non-critical labels in reports

The color palette is used to automatically color tagged time in reports.
When creating a color theme, the palette should be larger rather than smaller.
It is recommended that you provide at least 16 colors, otherwise Timewarrior cycles through them and you'll see repetitions.

## Share Your Theme

Having created a color theme, share it in the spirit of Open Source.
Make it available for download, or alternatively send it to us at:

    support@gothenburgbitfactory.org

We will list (and attribute) your theme on the Timewarrior support pages, where you will find other themes and extensions.
