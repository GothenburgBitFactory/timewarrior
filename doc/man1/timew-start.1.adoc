= timew-start(1)

== NAME
timew-start - start time tracking

== SYNOPSIS
[verse]
*timew start* [_<date>_] [_<tag>_**...**]

== DESCRIPTION
Begins tracking using the current time with any specified set of tags.
If a tag contains multiple words, therefore containing spaces, use quotes to surround the whole tag.

== EXAMPLES
For example, this command specifies two tags ('weekend' and 'Home & Garden'), the second of which requires quotes.

    $ timew start weekend 'Home & Garden'

An optional date may be specified to indicate the intended start of the tracked time:

    $ timew start 8am weekend 'Home & Garden'

If there is a previous open interval, it will be closed at the given start time.

Quotes are harmless if used unnecessarily.
