== NAME
timew-chart - display chart report

== SYNOPSIS
[verse]
*timew day* [_<range>_] [_<tag>_**...**]
*timew month* [_<range>_] [_<tag>_**...**]
*timew week* [_<range>_] [_<tag>_**...**]

== DESCRIPTION
A chart summarizes the tracked and untracked time with colored blocks drawn on a timeline.
It accepts date ranges and tags for filtering.
There are three types: *day*, *week*, and *month* with their respective commands.
The **reports.**__<type>__**.range** configuration setting overrides the default date range.
For more details, and precise times, use the 'summary' report.

*month*::
The month command shows a chart depicting a single month (current month by default).
The default date range shown is *:month*.

*week*::
The week command shows a chart depicting a single week (current week by default).
The default date range shown is *:week*.

*day*::
The day command shows a chart depicting a single day (today by default).
The default date range shown is *:day*.

== CONFIGURATION
_<type>_ is one of **month**, **week**, **day**.

**reports.**__<type>__**.cell**::
Determines how many minutes are represented by a single character cell, for the charts.
The value must be greater than '0'.
A value of '15' means that an hour is represented by 60/15, or 4 character cells.
Suitable values are the divisors of 60 (30, 20, 15, 12, ...).
Default value is '15'.

**reports.**__<type>__**.day**::
Determines whether the current day of the month is shown at left margin.
Default value is 'yes'.

**reports.**__<type>__**.holidays**::
Determines whether relevant holidays are shown beneath the report.
Default value is 'yes'.

**reports.**__<type>__**.hours**::
Determines how the <type> report shows all the hours in a day ('all'), or is limited to only hours where data is tracked ('auto').
Default value is 'all'.

**reports.**__<type>__**.lines**::
Determines how many lines are used to render each day on the <type> report.
Default value is '1'.

**reports.**__<type>__**.month**::
Determines whether the current month is shown at left margin.
Default value is 'yes'.

**reports.**__<type>__**.range**::
For reports that show a range of data, this setting will override the default value.
The value should be a range hint, see
**timew-hints**(7).

**reports.**__<type>__**.spacing**::
Specifies how many spaces are inserted between the hours in the <type> report exclusions.
A value of '0' yields a more compact report.
Default value is '1'.

**reports.**__<type>__**.axis**::
The value 'internal' puts the hour markers (time line at the top) inside the exclusion blocks, 'external' puts the hour markers in a separate line; additional values might be defined in the future.
Default is 'internal' for the day report and 'external' for other reports.

**reports.**__<type>__**.summary**::
Determines whether the hours summary is shown.
Default value is 'on'.

**reports.**__<type>__**.totals**::
Determines whether the time totals are shown for each day on the report.
Default value is 'on'.

**reports.**__<type>__**.week**::
Determines whether the current week number is shown at left margin.
Default value is 'yes'.

**reports.**__<type>__**.weekday**::
Determines whether the current weekday is shown at left margin.
Default value is 'yes'.

== HINTS

*:blank*::
The ':blank' hint causes only the excluded time to be shown, with no tracked time.
This can be used to see the exclusions.

*:ids*::
The ':ids' hint causes the intervals to be displayed with their ids

== EXAMPLES
Charts accept date ranges and tags for filtering, or shortcut hints:

    $ timew month 1st - today
    $ timew week FOO BAR
    $ timew day :week
