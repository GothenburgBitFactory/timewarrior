= timew-report(1)

== NAME
timew-report - run an extension report

== SYNOPSIS
[verse]
*timew* [*report*] _<report>_ [_<range>_] [_<tag>_**...**]

== DESCRIPTION
Runs an extension report, and supports filtering data.
The 'report' command itself is optional, which means that these two commands are equivalent:

    $ timew report foo :week
    $ timew        foo :week

This does however assume there is a 'foo' extension installed.

The return code is the return code of the extension.
If the extension produces no output and a non-zero rc, then 255 is returned.

== CONFIGURATION

**reports.range**::
Sets the default date range for all reports.
The value has to be a range hint, see timew-hints(7).
Defaults to `:all`

**reports.**__<name>__**.range**::
Set the date range for report _name_, where _name_ is the name of the report executable without its extension (i.e. a report executable 'foo.py' is referred to by 'foo').
The value has to be a range hint, see timew-hints(7).
