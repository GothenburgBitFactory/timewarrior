.SH NAME
timew-track \- add intervals to the database
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B timew track
.I <range>
[
.I <tag>
.B ...
]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The track command is used to add tracked time in the past.
Perhaps you forgot to record time, or are just filling in old entries.
.
.SH EXAMPLES
For example:
.RS
$ timew track :yesterday 'Training Course'
.br
$ timew track 9am - 11am 'Staff Meeting'
.RE
Note that the track command expects a closed interval (start and end time), when recording.
If a closed interval is not provided, the 'track' command behaves the same as the 'start' command.
