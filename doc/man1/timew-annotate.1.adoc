= timew-annotate(1)

== NAME
timew-annotate - add an annotation to intervals

== SYNOPSIS
[verse]
*timew annotate* [_<id>_**...**] _<annotation>_**...**

== DESCRIPTION
The 'annotate' command is used to add an annotation to an interval.
Using the 'summary' command, and specifying the ':ids' hint shows interval IDs.
Using the right ID, you can identify an interval to annotate.

== EXAMPLES
For example, show the IDs:

    $ timew summary :week :ids

Then having selected '@2' as the interval you wish to annotate:

    $ timew annotate @2 'Lorem ipsum...'

Note that you can annotate multiple intervals with the same annotation:

    $ timew annotate @2 @10 @23 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...'

If there is active time tracking, you can omit the ID when you want to add annotations to the current open interval:

    $ timew start foo
    $ timew annotate bar

This results in the current interval having annotations 'foo' and 'bar'.

== BUGS
Currently the annotation command picks the last token from the command line and uses it as annotation.
I.e. using no quotes in an annotation command like

    $ timew annotate @1 lorem ipsum dolor

will result in interval @1 having only 'dolor' as its annotation.
