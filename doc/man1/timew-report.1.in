.SH SYNOPSIS
.B timew
[
.B report

.I <report>
[
.I <range>
] [
.I <tag>
.B ...
]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Runs an extension report, and supports filtering data.
The 'report' command itself is optional, which means that these two commands are equivalent:
.RS
$ timew report foo :week
.br
$ timew        foo :week
.RE
This does however assume there is a 'foo' extension installed.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.BI reports. <script> .range
.RS
Defines the default range which is used if no <range> is given on the command line.
The <script> is the basename of the script, e.g. if the executable is called 'time-report.py' the configuration key is 'reports.time-report.py.range'.
.br
Default value is unset and this delivers all intervals to the extension report.
