== NAME
timew-hints - Timewarrior hints

== SYNOPSIS

== DESCRIPTION
Timewarrior supports hints, which are single-word command line features that start with a colon like this:

  :week

Hints serve several purposes.
This example is a shortcut for the date range that defines the current week.

Other hints, such as:

  :quiet

Are ways to control the behavior of Timewarrior, in this case eliminating all forms of feedback, for purposes of automation.

The supported hints are:

  :quiet         Turns off all feedback. For automation
  :debug         Runs in debug mode, shows many runtime details
  :yes           Overrides confirmation by answering 'yes' to the questions

  :color         Force color on, even if not connected to a TTY
  :nocolor       Force color off, even if connected to a TTY
  :blank         Leaves tracked time out of a report
  :fill          Expand time to fill surrounding available gap
  :adjust        Automatically correct overlaps
  :ids           Displays interval ID numbers in the summary report

Range hints provide convenient shortcuts to date ranges:

  :yesterday     The 24 hours of the previous day
  :day           The 24 hours of the current day
  :week          This week
