.SH SYNOPSIS
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Timewarrior supports hints, which are single-word command line features that start with a colon like this:
.
  :week
.br
Hints serve several purposes.
This example is a shortcut for the date range that defines the current week.
.br
Other hints, such as:
.
  :quiet
.br
Are ways to control the behavior of Timewarrior, in this case eliminating all forms of feedback, for purposes of automation.
