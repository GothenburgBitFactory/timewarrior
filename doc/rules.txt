Rules System
============
The Timewarrior rule system reads your ~/.timewarrior/timewarrior.cfg file and
uses the combination of configuration settings and logic within to:

- Provide configuration and customization details
- Define tags, exclusions, constraints
- Enact various policies

The rules are a mechanism to apply late-bound logic and data to various
functions. Whenever data changes, the rule system is run, which will run each
rule in turn, if it applies, going from top to bottom in the rules file. There
are no chained rules, but errors will be able to terminate rule processing and
program execution.

As much functionality as possible is to be deferred to the rules system, which
will initially be minimal, but grow to be come more capable.


Format
------
The rules are written as UTF8 text in the ~/.timewarrior/timewarrior.cfg text
file. Other rules files may be included:

  import /path/to/other/rule/file

The syntax of rules is Python-like, in that indentation is significant.


Types of Rules
--------------
There are several different types of rules, for example there is the rule that
defines all exclusions:

  define exclusions:
    ...

There are general rules triggered by changes to the data:

  define rule one:
    ...

There are rules that define tags and their metadata:

  define tags:
    "tag1":
      ...

There are rules that will serve as hooks:

  define rules:
    on_stop:
      ...


Rule Type: Exclusions
---------------------
Because exclusions are resolved at run time, and only when needed, they should
be stored in a readily-interpreted form:

  define exclusions:
    monday    = <8:00:00 12:00:00-12:45:00 >17:30:00
    tuesday   = <8:00:00 12:00:00-12:45:00 >18:30:00
    wednesday = <8:00 12:00-13:30 >17:30
    thursday  = <8:00 12:00-12:45 >17:30
    friday    = <8:00 12:00-12:45 >17:30

    days:
      2016_01_01 = Working
      2016_01_02 = Off

If you want to track your lunch breaks, then you would make a tag for it, and
track it like any other project. If you do not want to track that time, add an
exclusion for it.


Rule Type: General
------------------
There are rules triggered by changes to the data. In this example, rule 'one'
is a constraint that prevents the value 'foo' from exceeding three. It is
triggered by a change to 'foo', which is a DOM reference, and can prevent the
update by failing:

  define rules:
    one:
      tagset = tag1
      if foo > 3:
        error "The value of 'foo' may not exceed 3."

Note that this rule is defined as applying to the tagset 'tag1'.


Rule Type: Tag
--------------
A defined tag is a way to associate metadata with a tag, such as a description
and start/end dates for use:

  define tags:
    "tag1":
      description = "Description of tag1"
      start       = 2016-01-01
      end         = 2016-06-30
      budget      = 20 hours per week
      budget      = 400 hours total
      overlap     = yes


Rule Type: Theme
----------------
A color theme is defined by a rule, and consists of color definitions for
various report and feedback elements:

  define theme:
    description = "A monochrome, 256-color theme"
    color:
      today = "black on rgb521"
      ...
    palette:
      color1 = "white on red"
      color2 = "white on blue"
      ...

The palette group is a list (more is better) of themed colors for use when auto-
coloring tags.

There is only one theme namespace, so if multiple themes are imported, the last
one can override all the prior theme settings. This means themes can be layered,
but they would need to be designed for this.


Rule Type: Hook
---------------
While there may not be hooks in the traditional sense, with fixed arguments,
there will be rules that have the same role. Hook rules will allow an internal
event to trigger a rule that calls an external script, and passes an arbitrary
set of arguments.

[Mechanism TBD]

    define rules:
      on_start:
        ...

    define rules:
      on_stop:
        ...

    define rules:
      on_modify:
        ...

These rules can run an external script and provide arguments, based on rules
DOM access:

    define rules:
      on_modify:
        run /path/to/my/script <dom1> <dom2>


Rules Type: Hint
----------------
Hints may be defined using the rules system, to augment the built-in hints that
are used by almost every command.

    define hints:
      staff:
        tag 'Staff Meeting'
        tag 'Admin'

[More TBD]


--- Raw Notes ---

- Need to distinguish between regular time and over time, with different rates
  and limits.

- Policy support involves things like:
  - warn after 40 hrs/wk
  - cut off tracking a tag at x hrs/wk
  - auto-tag intervals that exceed 40 hrs/wk
  - auto-tag intervals during exclusion time

- Need to distinguish between rules that will be supported at 1.0.0, and the
  long term enhancements.

- There will need to be several built-in functions, for use by rules:

    error("...")         Emits and terminates
    warning("...")       Emits and continues
    info("...")          Emits and continues
    sum_week("tag1")     Sums minutes in the current week for "tag1"

  These are not good examples.

- Need reports to help users doing fixed-rate work - finding the longest task
  for example.

- If an interval has more than one tag with a defined color, and is being
  rendered, then use the first tag color. It doesn't really matter which.

- Use display granularity/resolution to see more or less details.  This would
  combine nicely with a tag hierarchy. (Tomas Babej)
