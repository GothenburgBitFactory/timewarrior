Installation Instructions
-------------------------

Please follow the instructions below to build and install Timewarrior from
source.


Dependencies
------------

In order to build Timewarrior, you will need:

  - cmake (See https://cmake.org)
  - make

You will need a C++ compiler that supports full C++11, which includes:
  - gcc 4.9   (released 2014-04-22)
  - clang 3.4 (released 2014-01-02)


Basic Installation
------------------

Briefly, these shell commands will unpack, build and install Timewarrior:

  $ tar xzf timew-X.Y.Z.tar.gz                  [1]
  $ cd timew-X.Y.Z                              [2]
  $ cmake .                                     [3]
  $ make                                        [4]
  $ sudo make install                           [5]
  $ cd .. ; rm -r timew-X.Y.Z                   [6]

These commands are explained below:

  1. Unpacks the source tarball.  This creates the directory timew-X.Y.Z,
     containing all the code.

  2. Change directory to the root of the distribution.

  3. Invokes CMake to scan for dependencies and machine-specific details, then
     generate the makefiles.  This may take a minute.

  4. Builds Timewarrior.  This may take a minute.

  5. Installs the program, documentation and other data files.

  6. Removes the temporary directory.


Build and configurations options
--------------------------------

You can customize the configuration run with cmake variables. This will modify
the installation process:

To change the installation directory you use the following configuration
variable:

  $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path-to-installation-dir> .

cmake configuration variables are applied with the -D option and consist of a
<name> and a <value>:

  $ cmake -D<name>=<value> .

Four more variables can customize the installation process. The following table
lists them and their defaults plus the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:

  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX   /usr/local
  TIMEW_BINDIR           bin
  TIMEW_DOCDIR           share/doc/timew
  TIMEW_RCDIR            share/doc/timew/rc
  TIMEW_MAN1DIR          share/man/man1
  TIMEW_MAN5DIR          share/man/man5

The corresponding TIMEW_* variables will be combined with CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to
get absolute installation directories:

  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/TIMEW_BINDIR   /usr/local/bin
  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/TIMEW_DOCDIR   /usr/local/share/doc/timew
  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/TIMEW_RCDIR    /usr/local/share/doc/timew/rc
  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/TIMEW_MAN1DIR  /usr/local/share/man/man1
  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/TIMEW_MAN5DIR  /usr/local/share/man/man5


Updating Timewarrior build
--------------------------

This section concerns itself with the description of the procedure needed to
update the local Timewarrior build from the 'timew' git repository.

To update the local Timewarrior build, you need to update the git repository,
including the 'src/libshared' submodule. To do that, run:

  $ git pull --recurse-submodules
  $ git submodule update

At this point you have the fully updated sources at your disposal and you can
update your local build following the regular build instructions:

  $ cmake .
  $ make
  $ sudo make install


Uninstallation
--------------

There is no uninstall option in CMake makefiles. This is a manual process.

To uninstall Timewarrior, remove the files listed in the install_manifest.txt
file that was generated when you built Timewarrior.


Timewarrior Build Notes
-----------------------

Timewarrior has dependencies that are detected by CMake in almost all cases, but
there are situations and operating systems that mean you will need to offer a
little help.

If Timewarrior will not build on your system, first take a look at the Operating
System notes below.  If this doesn't help, then go to the Troubleshooting
section, which includes instructions on how to contact us for help.


Operating System Notes
----------------------

Cygwin
  If 'make install' fails when writing to the /usr/local/share/ directory,
  this may be because your current login doesn't have permission to write
  to the Windows directory containing your Cygwin installation. Either
  login to Windows as an Administrator and try the 'make install' process
  again, or reinstall Cygwin under your normal Windows login.


Troubleshooting
---------------

If you've recently made changes to dependencies (by reinstalling them, for
example) be sure to rerun 'cmake .' before trying to execute 'make' again.

CMake will run and locate all the necessary pieces for the build, and create
a Makefile.  There may be errors and warnings when running CMake, or there
may be compiler errors and warnings when running 'make'.  Sometimes you will run
CMake with no reported problems, and the build will fail later.  This is
almost always because CMake is mistaken about some assumption.

If a build does not succeed, please send the contents of the 'CMakeCache.txt'
and 'CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log' files to support@gothenburgbitfactory.org.

If CMake runs but Timewarrior does not build, please send the contents of the
above files as well as a transcript from the build, which is not written to a
file and must be captured from the terminal.
