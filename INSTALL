# Installation Instructions

Please follow the instructions below to build and install Timewarrior from source.


# Dependencies

In order to build Timewarrior, you will need:

  - cmake (See https://cmake.org)
  - make

You will need a C++ compiler that supports full C++11, which includes:
  - gcc 4.8.1 (released 2013-03-31)
  - clang 3.3 (released 2013-06-17)


# Basic Installation

Briefly, these shell commands will unpack, build and install Timewarrior:

    $ tar xzf timew-X.Y.Z.tar.gz                  [1]
    $ cd timew-X.Y.Z                              [2]
    $ cmake .                                     [3]
    $ make                                        [4]
    $ sudo make install                           [5]
    $ cd .. ; rm -r timew-X.Y.Z                   [6]

These commands are explained below:

  1. Unpacks the source tarball.
     This creates the directory timew-X.Y.Z, containing all the code.

  2. Change directory to the root of the distribution.

  3. Invokes CMake to scan for dependencies and machine-specific details, then generate the makefiles.
     This may take a minute.

  4. Builds Timewarrior.
     This may take a minute.

  5. Installs the program, documentation and other data files.

  6. Removes the temporary directory.


# Build and configurations options

You can customize the configuration run with cmake variables.
This will modify the installation process:

To change the installation directory you use the following configuration variable:

    $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path-to-installation-dir> .

cmake configuration variables are applied with the -D option and consist of a <name> and a <value>:

    $ cmake -D<name>=<value> .

Four more variables can customize the installation process.
The following table lists them and their defaults plus the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`:

    CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX   /usr/local
    TIMEW_BINDIR           bin
    TIMEW_DOCDIR           share/doc/timew
    TIMEW_RCDIR            share/doc/timew/rc
    TIMEW_MAN1DIR          share/man/man1
    TIMEW_MAN5DIR          share/man/man5
    TIMEW_MAN7DIR          share/man/man7

The corresponding `TIMEW_*` variables will be combined with `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` to get absolute installation directories:

    CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/TIMEW_BINDIR   /usr/local/bin
    CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/TIMEW_DOCDIR   /usr/local/share/doc/timew
    CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/TIMEW_RCDIR    /usr/local/share/doc/timew/rc
    CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/TIMEW_MAN1DIR  /usr/local/share/man/man1
    CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/TIMEW_MAN5DIR  /usr/local/share/man/man5
    CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/TIMEW_MAN7DIR  /usr/local/share/man/man7


# Updating Timewarrior build

This section concerns itself with the description of the procedure needed to update the local Timewarrior build from the 'timew' git repository.

To update the local Timewarrior build, you need to update the git repository, including the `src/libshared` submodule.
To do that, run:

    $ git pull --recurse-submodules
    $ git submodule update

At this point you have the fully updated sources at your disposal and you can update your local build following the regular build instructions:

    $ cmake .
    $ make
    $ sudo make install


# Uninstallation

There is no uninstall option in CMake makefiles.
This is a manual process.

To uninstall Timewarrior, remove the files listed in the `install_manifest.txt` file that was generated when you built Timewarrior.


# Timewarrior Build Notes

Timewarrior has dependencies that are detected by CMake in almost all cases, but there are situations and operating systems that mean you will need to offer a little help.

If Timewarrior will not build on your system, first take a look at the Operating System notes below.
If this doesn't help, then go to the Troubleshooting section, which includes instructions on how to contact us for help.


# Operating System Notes

## Cygwin

If `make install` fails when writing to the `/usr/local/share/` directory, this may be because your current login doesn't have permission to write to the Windows directory containing your Cygwin installation.

Either login to Windows as an Administrator and try the `make install` process again, or reinstall Cygwin under your normal Windows login.


# Troubleshooting

If you've recently made changes to dependencies (by reinstalling them, for example) be sure to rerun `cmake .` before trying to execute `make` again.

CMake will run and locate all the necessary pieces for the build, and create a Makefile.
There may be errors and warnings when running CMake, or there may be compiler errors and warnings when running `make`.
Sometimes you will run CMake with no reported problems, and the build will fail later.
This is almost always because CMake is mistaken about some assumption.

If a build does not succeed, please send the contents of the `CMakeCache.txt` and `CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log` files to `support@gothenburgbitfactory.org`. 

If CMake runs but Timewarrior does not build, please send the contents of the above files as well as a transcript from the build, which is not written to a file and must be captured from the terminal.
