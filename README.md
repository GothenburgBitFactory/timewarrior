# Timewarrior

Thank you for taking a look at Timewarrior!

Timewarrior is a time tracking utility that offers simple stopwatch features as well as sophisticated calendar-based backfill, along with flexible reporting.
It is a portable, well supported and very active Open Source project.

## Installing

### From Package

Thanks to the community, there are binary packages available [here](https://taskwarrior.org/docs/timewarrior/download.html#Distributions).

### Building Timewarrior

Building Timewarrior yourself requires

* git
* cmake
* make
* C++ compiler, currently gcc 4.7+ or clang 3.3+ for full C++11 support
* Python, for running the testsuite

There are two ways to retrieve the Timewarrior sources:

* Clone the repository from Github,

      git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/timewarrior
      cd timewarrior

* Or download the tarball with curl,

      curl -O https://taskwarrior.org/download/timew-1.1.1.tar.gz

  and expand the tarball

      tar xzf timew-1.1.1.tar.gz
      cd timew-1.1.1

Build Timewarrior, optionally run the test suite (note: the tarball does not contain tests), and install it.

    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release
    make
    [make test]
    sudo make install

This copies files into the right place (default under `/usr/local`), and installs man pages.

Add the optional parameter `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/your/install/location` to the `cmake` command if you want to install Timewarrior at a location other than `/usr/local`.
The `make install` command may not require `sudo` depending on your choice of install location.
